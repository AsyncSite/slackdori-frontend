# Technical Decisions Log

## 2024-01-10: Simplified Project Structure

### Decision
Remove all unnecessary complexity from initial setup.

### Why
- 952-line documentation but only 200 lines of code
- Over-engineered ESLint rules blocking development
- Premature optimization causing redirect loops

### Changes
- Reduced CLAUDE.md from 952 to 91 lines
- Simplified ESLint (warnings only, no blocking)
- Removed 20+ unused dependencies
- Simplified Next.js config from 232 to 18 lines

### Result
- Faster development velocity
- Clearer codebase
- Easier onboarding

## 2024-01-10: TypeScript Strict Mode OFF

### Decision
Disabled TypeScript strict mode for MVP phase.

### Why
- Slows down prototyping
- Not needed for MVP validation
- Can enable later when codebase stabilizes

### Trade-off
- Less type safety â†’ Faster iteration
- Will revisit after product-market fit

---

## 2024-01-10: No Testing Framework (Yet)

### Decision
Removed Jest, Playwright, and testing infrastructure.

### Why
- No users yet = no need for regression testing
- Manual testing sufficient for MVP
- Setup time better spent on features

### When to Add
- After first paying customer
- When bug reports become frequent
- When team grows beyond 2 developers
