## üß≠ Decision Framework

### When to Build vs Buy
- **Build**: Core functionality, SEO-critical features
- **Buy/Use SaaS**: Analytics, monitoring, non-core features

### When to Optimize
- **Optimize**: Only when metrics show it's needed
- **Measure First**: Use Lighthouse, Analytics, user feedback

### Technical Debt
- **Accept**: In non-critical areas during MVP
- **Fix**: When it blocks features or hurts SEO
- **Document**: Always note shortcuts taken

## üîë Key Principles
1. **SEO > Features** - Better to rank with fewer features
2. **Speed > Perfection** - Ship daily, improve weekly
3. **Data > Opinion** - Let metrics guide decisions
4. **Simple > Clever** - Boring technology, exciting product

## üìÖ Weekly Priorities
- **Monday**: Plan week, review metrics
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: Build features
- **Friday**: SEO improvements, content creation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigations
- **Slack API changes**: Keep implementation simple, abstract API layer
- **SEO competition**: Focus on long-tail keywords first
- **Monetization**: Start with ads, test premium later
